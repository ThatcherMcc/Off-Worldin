# "Off World"
### Intro
Space exploration game where you integrate alien anatomy into the player character. Looking to create something where you have to capture weaker aliens to make it easier to catch medium threats and so on. Where bosses are the highest level threat and best abilities.

### Disclaimer 1/19
For now, this repo still requires some cleaning because there are a lot of unused assets that may add to download times and clutter. I recommend looking for the exact script or model you'd like to download specifically.
